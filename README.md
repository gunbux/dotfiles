# Chun's Personal Dotfiles

This repo will contain all my personal dotfiles

## Currently in repo:
1. neovim
2. bspwm
3. sxhkd
4. scripts

## Things Missing:

- Password Manager
- Wallpaper configuration
- Polybar configuration
- Picom configuration

## TODO:
1. Create scripts for installing linux, managing xrandr and other misc. tasks.
2. Create script for symlinking all dotfiles from git repo.

## Branches
As of January 2021, this repo will have two branches for two of my machines, my first main machine, and my iPad running Alpine Linux via iSH.

# The iPad Branch
This branch will be used mainly for my iPad Air 3 running Alpine on iSH. Due to the low RAM,  I found that the dotfiles I use, such as those for neovim cause the development environment to be slightly laggy and unresponsive, so this branch will provide a more skeletal version of the main dotfiles I use on my machine.

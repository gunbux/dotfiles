# Chun's Personal Dotfiles

This repo will contain all my personal dotfiles. The awesome configuration is a personal fork of elenapan's awesome dotfiles found here. The picom configuration was also taken from elenapan, but modified for jonaburg's fork of picom, which contains commits for tryone's dual kawase blur, ibhagwan's rounded corners, as well as blackcapcoder's animations.

## Currently in repo:
1. neovim

3. scripts

## Things Missing:

- Password Manager

2. Create script for symlinking all dotfiles from git repo.

## Branches
As of January 2021, this repo will have two branches for two of my machines, my first main machine, and my iPad running Alpine Linux via iSH.
